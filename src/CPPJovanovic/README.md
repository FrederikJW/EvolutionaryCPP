R. Jovanovic, A. P. Sanfilippo, and S. Voß, “Fixed set search applied to the clique partitioning problem,” European Journal of Operational Research, vol. 309, no. 1, pp. 65–81, Aug. 2023. DOI: 10.1016/j.ejor.2023.01.044.

In addition to translating the repository, additional SALO based algorithms have been implemented by Frederik Weber based on the implementation in this directory.
Those algorithms are presented in the diploma thesis "Metaheuristic algorithms for clique partitioning" and are: SALODM, SALODMS, SALODM0, SALOeC
